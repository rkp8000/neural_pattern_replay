    "### Replay capacity analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "How many different sequences can a network reliably replay? Mathematically, this is equivalent to asking how many sequences can be specified purely through an unordered *set* of involved ensembles (marked by lingering hyperexcitability), and through the first ensemble in the sequence. This so-called replay capacity will of course depend on the network architecture. In this analysis, we restrict our analysis to networks with binary, directed connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, there should be a nontrivial connectivity matrix that maximizes the replay capacity of a network. If the network has no connections, no sequences can be specified by a set of hyperexcitable ensembles: after the first ensemble activates, all other hyperexcitable ensembles will activate with equal probability, since none of them receives input from the first ensemble. On the other hand, no sequences can be specified in a fully connected network either, since after the first ensemble activates, again all other hyperexcitable ensembles will activate with equal probability, since they always receive increased but equal input from the first ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we quantify the replay capacity of networks with a variety of different connectivities. To perform this calculation we precisely define the replay capacity of a network to be the number of replayable sequences it contains, where we call a sequence of ensembles replayable if the following is true:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The sequence traces out a path through the network.\n",
    "2. If one starts at the first ensemble in the sequence and considers only the subnetwork defined by the set of ensembles in the sequence and the existing connections between them, then no ensemble (except potentially the last) has more than one target directly downstream of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simply quantifies the notion that if one knows the *set* of ensembles in the sequence as well as the starting ensemble, then there should be no ambiguity in determining the order.\n",
